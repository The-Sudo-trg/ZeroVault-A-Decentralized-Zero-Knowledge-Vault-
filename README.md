# ZeroVault: Zero-Knowledge Identity & Document Vault

ZeroVault is a decentralized application (dApp) that uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and blockchain technology to allow users to store and verify sensitive identity or asset information without revealing the data itself.

## 🔐 Features

- **🔒 Zero-Knowledge Identity Verification**: Users can prove their age, nationality, or eligibility without sharing the actual data.
- **🧠 Encrypted Vaults on IPFS**: Store personal documents (Aadhaar, passport, private contracts) in encrypted form off-chain using IPFS.
- **🛡 ZK-Login System**: Authenticate users using zk-SNARKs based verification (like Semaphore or zkLogin).
- **🔗 Smart Contracts**: Manage user registration, permissions, and ownership on Ethereum or Polygon.
- **📦 Frontend**: Simple UI/UX for users to register, upload, and share proofs.

## 📁 Tech Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum or Polygon
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity / Foundry
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, Wagmi, Ethers.js
- **Storage**: IPFS via Web3.Storage
- **ZKP Library**: SnarkJS / Circom / zk-SNARKs
